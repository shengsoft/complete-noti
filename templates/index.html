              <h3>What is a Representative Payee?</h3>
              <p>
                A representative payee is someone the Social Security Administration appoints to manage the funds of a 
                recipient that cannot do so for themselves. A "PayeePro" as we say here, will manage the benefits received
                to the best of their ability ensuring the recipient maintains the highest possible quality of life.

             <h3>How is PayeePro different from other payee services?</h3>
             <p>
              PayeePro isn't your average payee service, we established this company with the customer at the center of everything. 
              From our website to our unique programs and membership perks everything we do is for you. We pride ourselves on our

             <h3>How do I know if PayeePro is right for me?</h3>
             <p>
              If you are a recipient of funds and you do not feel that you or the person you are assisting is capable of 
              managing those funds to their best benefit then a PayeePro can be assigned to you today!
